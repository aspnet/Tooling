# Known issues for Web Tools, and ASP.NET and ASP.NET/.NET Core in Visual Studio 2017

## ASP.NET Core Known Issues

### Visual Studio 2015 fails to restore NuGet packages after install Visual Studio 2017
After installing Visual Studio 2017 RC on the same machine as Visual Studio 2015 with .NET Core tooling, restoring NuGet packages in an ASP.NET Core project using Visual Studio 2015 fails

* #### Issue: 
On a machine that already has VS 2015 with .NET Core Tooling, if you install VS 2017 RC and then try to restore packages for an ASP.NET project using VS 2015, it might fail with the following error message: 

  MSBUILD : error MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded. Data at the root level is invalid. Line 1, position 1 

* #### Workaround: 
Install the latest update for [.NET Core VS 2015 tooling](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2015) to resolve the above error. After installing this update, you will be able to restore NuGet packages again using VS 2015.

### Docker enabled project fails to build
Project fails to build if you enable Docker Support without 'Docker for Windows' installed 

* #### Issue:  
When creating an ASP.NET Core project, if you check the "Enable Container (Docker) Support" checkbox but do not have "Docker for Windows" installed, the created project will fail to build with the following error: 

  Microsoft.DotNet.Docker.CommandLineClientException: 'docker-compose' was not found. Please verify that it is available on %PATH%, or for troubleshooting, follow instructions from http://aka.ms/DockerToolsTroubleshooting 

* #### Workaround: 
Install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) to resolve the issue

### No suggestions to install missing packages
Ctrl+. Light Bulbs does not work with extension methods in .NET Core or ASP.NET Core projects 

* #### Issue: 
Pressing Ctrl+. on unresolved references to extension methods does not provide a lightbulb with helpful shortcuts to install the required package 

* #### Workaround: 
Manually find and install the package using Manage NuGet packages UI

### Tag Helpers do not work
Razor Tag Helpers do not work in .NET Core projects 

* #### Issue: 
Razor Tag Helpers do not get colorization or special IntelliSense at design time in RC.  They work normally at runtime. 

* #### Workaround: 
None available

### TypeScript files do not compile
TypeScript files not compiled in .NET Core projects 

* #### Issue: 
TypeScript files are not automatically compiled on save in .NET Core projects 

* #### Workaround: 
Add a tsconfig.json file to the root of the project, containing at least {}.

### Sequence numbers added to wronge item templates
Sequence numbers are added to inappropriate Item Templates 

* #### Issue: 
In Core projects, item templates such as "npm Configuration File", "Bower Configuration File", "Grunt/Gulp Configuration File", etc., which work only with specific names, are created with an extra "1" inserted before the end of the file name. 

* #### Workaround: 
Edit the supplied file name before or after creating the file. 

### Bundle and Minify not working
Bundle and Minify is not operating in Core projects created from VS project templates

* #### Issue:
Bundle and Minify commands are commented out in csproj files created from project templates.

* #### Workaround:
  * Create a Core web application project
  * Right-click on the project node in Solution Explorer and select "Exid [projectname].csproj
  * Ignore the warning about line enndings.  (Known issue.)
  *  At the botom of the csproj file, find:
  ```xml
   <Target Name="BeforePublish">
    <Exec Command="bower install" />
    <Exec Command="dotnet bundle" />
  </Target>
```
Replace with:
```xml
   <Target Name="BeforePublish">
    <!--
    <Exec Command="bower install" />
    -->
    <Exec Command="dotnet bundle" />
  </Target>
  ```
(The bower install command is not ready for RC and will be fixed in an upcoming release.)
To invoke bundling and minification, publish the project.  For example, publish to file system.

### Scaffolded files not included in project
Scaffolded files may not be included in user's project in certain cases, where user's project defines exclusions.

* #### Issue:  
If user project has a globbing pattern for ```<Compile>``` item group with a exclude pattern. And if the files generated by scaffolding match the pattern, they are not included in the project. For example: If project has ```<Compile Include = "**/*.cs" Exclude="ExcludedDir/*.cs" />``` and scaffolding generates a file in 'DefaultController.cs' ExcludedDir, it will not be included in the project for compilation. 

* #### Workaround: 
Manually adjust the globbing pattern to include the 'ExcludedDir/DefaultController'

### Core Console/Class library  publish dialog not showing the right RID's
The Publish profile settings dialog for a .NET Core Console/Class library does not show the right RID's

* #### Issue: 
Core Console/Class lib Publish Profile Settings Dialog shows only Portable RID when the user wants to add a RID by adding a RuntimeIdentifier element in the project file 

* #### Workaround:
If the user wants to only add one runtime identifier to the project, instead of adding the RuntimeIdentifier element, add a RuntimeIdentifiers element, for example:

```XML
<RuntimeIdentifiers>win7-x86</RuntimeIdentifiers>
```

### Published .exe of a .NET Core Console App sometimes fails when running
The published .exe of a Console App with a win7-x86 RID and Release configuration sometimes fails when running

* #### Issue: 
After publishing a Console App with a win7-x86 RID and Release configuration, running the published .exe sometimes gives the error: 'Unhandled Exception: System.BadImageFormatException: Could not load file or assembly 'CoreConsoleProject.dll'. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.'

* #### Workaround:
Run dotnet new before publishing.

### Ambiguity error during scaffolding controller with Entity Framework
Error message regarding ambiguity between DataContext member names during scaffolding controller using EntityFrameworkCore

* #### Issue:
If the DataContext class has a member (property, method, variable) defined with the same name as the Model class being used for scaffolding fails with an error as below:<br/>
![amiguity error dialog](./images/vs2017-ambiguity-error.png)

* #### Workaround:
Add a DbSet<> property to the DataContext class for the model which will be used for scaffolding manually and then retry scaffolding
`public DbSet<ClassName> MemberName { get; set; }`
