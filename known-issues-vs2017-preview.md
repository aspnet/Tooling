## .NET Core Known Issues

### Dependencies node in solution explorer shows with a warning icon until restore is complete

* #### Issue: 
When you create or open an existing .NET Core or ASP.NET Core project using Visual Studio 2017, the dependencies node shows warnings until all packages are restored and intellisense is ready. See [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2079) for details.

* #### Workaround:
Simply wait for package restore to complete and the warnings will go away

* #### Workaround:
You can resolve this by installing the [15.3.0 Preview 3 update to VS 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-preview-relnotes). 

### Inconsistent build behavior in certain scenarios between Visual Studio and dotnet CLI

* #### Issue: 
You see inconsistent build behavior between CLI and VS for projects that explicitly define PackageTargetFallback element in csproj file. CLI build fails with errors and VS build doesn’t.
 
* #### Workaround:
We will fix this in the next release. Until then please find and replace  PackageTargetFallback with AssetTargetFallback in csproj file.

### Live Unit Testing option to start on solution load doesn't work for .NET Core projects 

* #### Issue: 
If you enable "Start Live Unit Testing on solution load", which is an option available in Tools/Options/Live Unit Testing, it doesn't work. 

* #### Workaround:
No workaround available. You have to manually start Live Unit Testing after the solution loads. We will fix this in the next release.

### F# templates are not present in Visual Studio IDE 

* #### Issue: 
F# templates are not present in VS IDE. We will fix this in the next release. You can use dotnet CLI to create F# projects. However there is an issue with F# MVC projects, where you will see a compilation failure.

* #### Workaround:
We have fixed the compilation failure in a newer .NET Core SDK build. You can install the latest daily build of the .NET Core SDK from https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/release/2.0.0-preview2#build-status by choosing the appropriate package from the Installers and Binaries table.

## ASP.NET Core 2.0 and Web Tools Known Issues

### Warning in the error list that Microsoft.Composition 1.0.27 was restored in a way that may cause compatibility problems

* #### Issue: 
When you create a new ASP.NET Core 2.0 project using the Web Application template with 'Individual User Accounts' authentication, or when you use scaffolding to add Minimal Dependencies to an ASP.NET Core 2.0 project created using the Empty template, you get a warning in the error list about Microsoft.Composition 1.0.27 getting restored in a way that may cause compatibility problems. 
	
The package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design depends on Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces, which in turn 
depends on the Microsoft.Composition v 1.0.27 which causes this incompatibility warning.

None. The warning is benign and can be ignored. 

### When you drag a file out of wwwroot to the project root, you get error 'Failed to update the project tree'
