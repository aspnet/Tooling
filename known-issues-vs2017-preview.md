## .NET Core Known Issues

### Dependencies node in solution explorer shows with a warning icon until restore is complete

* #### Issue: 
When you create or open an existing .NET Core or ASP.NET Core project using Visual Studio 2017, the dependencies node shows warnings until all packages are restored and intellisense is ready. See [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2079) for details.

* #### Workaround:
Simply wait for package restore to complete and the warnings will go away

## ASP.NET and Web Tools Known Issues

### Certificate error when trying to apply EF migrations or using code generation

### Cannot resolve scoped service error when trying to apply EF migrations or during code generation using existing DbContext

* #### Issue:

* #### Workaround:
Modify the code in Program.cs and try again


_Change_: 
```
     public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .Build();
```

_To_: 
```
     public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .UseDefaultServiceProvider(options =>
                    options.ValidateScopes=false)
                .Build();
```


### Add-Migration command fails with Exception calling "Substring"

* #### Issue: 
In an ASP.NET Core 2.0 project, when trying to use the NuGet Package Manager Console to add migrations using Add-Migration cmdlet or Update-Database, you get the following error : 
```
Add-Migration : Exception calling "Substring" with "1" argument(s): "StartIndex cannot be less than zero.
Parameter name: startIndex"
```

* #### Workaround:
This error is actually pretty safe to ignore - [see here](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/8163) for more info. If you look at the Solution Explorer, you can see that the migration actually got added. 
 
Alternatively, you can use "dotnet ef migrations add" to add the migration instead of the PowerShell cmdlet
